Hi all, my name is Alexandre Simoes but you can call me Alex.  
I'm originally from Portugal but moved to Switzerland in 2012.

I'm a software developer with a strong Microsoft background but that never inhibited me from working with other technologies. My tool belt holds technologies that include Windows and Linux, .Net Framework and JAVA, thin and thick clients, Front-End and Back-End environments, full custom and product customization solutions.

Iâ€™m an active contributor at <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/members/AlexCode.html">Experts-Exchange</a> and I regularly organize presentations and trainings.

Reviving this blog came out of the need of sharing my professional ideas, successes, problems and frustrations.  
Join me on this ride, I'll try to keep it interesting.
