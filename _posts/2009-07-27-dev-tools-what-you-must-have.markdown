<p>
Here's a list of tools I find useful while developing.<br />
I'll keep updating this list as I find or remember more! :)
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rweigelt/default.aspx">GhostDoc </a>- Helps you a lot documenting everything on your code.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/">CodeRush</a> - Powerful Visual Studio Add-in. I tried a lot of add-ins like this one but this is without a doubt the best of them. Powerful, very light weight, very easy to customize and enable/disable features... very good.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.brianapps.net/sizer.html">Sizer</a> - If you're a web developer this is a must have. It will let you size your windows to a resolution so you can test your web pages without needing to change the monitor resolution.</li>
    <li><a href="http://iconico.com/colorpic/">ColorPic</a> - Very good color picker with very good functionalities.</li>
    <li><a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a> - Best notepad around for developers!</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.paint.net/">Paint.net</a> - Very very very good drawing and image editor tool</li>
</ul>

Others "Nice to have"

    <li><a href="http://www.cocoonsoftware.com/">Quick Media Converter</a> - Converts all your video and audio media to and from a myriad of formats.</li>
    <li><a href="http://greenshot.sourceforge.net/">Greenshot</a> - Very nice screenshot tool</li>
</ul>
