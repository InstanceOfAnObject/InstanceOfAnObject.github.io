<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin: 10px;">
    <a href="/assets/blog/browser-chrome.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
        <img border="0" src="/assets/blog/browser-chrome.jpg" />
    </a>
</div>

<p>
Recently Google added a new feature to its web browser application that enable users to view PDF file without the ADOBE's plugin. This viewer is installed on a normal and automatic Google Chrome update and sets it self as the default viewer disabling the&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;installed Adobe's Reader plugin.<br />
It looks nice at first dispite the problem that it sucks.<br />
It lacks functionality and worst than that, have a bug that in some cases zooms out your entire webpage to unreadable values.
</p>

To avoid troubles and get back to what works you must:
<ol>
    <li>write the following on you address bar: <b>about:plugins</b></li>
    <li>On the top-right corner of the page click <b>"Details"</b>.</li>
    <li>Now scroll down until you find the <b>"Chrome PDF Viewer"</b> and click <b>Disable</b>.</li>
    <li>Now search for the Adobe Reader plugin <b>"Adobe Reader X"</b> and <b>Enable</b> it (if not already).</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you don't have Adobe Reader installed go to www.adobe.com and download it.<br />
I also recommend that you have the latest stable version of Google Chrome and Adobe Reader installed.
