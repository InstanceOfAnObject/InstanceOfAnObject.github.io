"So, I've decided to take my work back underground"... and start using Jekyll.

It's been a while since I messed up my Blogger theme and even longer since the last time I actually posted something on my blog.  
As I decided to come back to writting, I've set my self up to find an alternative to Blogger.

My first option was [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).  
For whoever doesn't know about it, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a publishing platform based on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and (Express)[http://expressjs.com/]. 
The community is very active and the product features are pretty impressive.  
The problem is that I don't intend to collaborate or do anything else than put some words out there. Most of all, I didn't want to have a database to store static content.

I want to write and publish. Done.

That's when I found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  
Actually to put it correctly, I found it through Github when I was reading about what it supports as publising platforms for project and user pages.

Jekyll it self is not a blogging platform, is "simply" an HTML generator.  
What you get as a publisher is a set of static HTML files that you can just deploy wherever you want.  
In my case I'm using Github pages and it works just fine.
