Microsoft is joining the Containers party with Windows 2016 natively supporting docker containers.
As I went to dig in, I decided to document my journey.

## First things first, what are containers?
Well, this is an common topic around these days.  
I'll be using [Docker](http://www.docker.com) so please refer to [their site](http://www.docker.com/what-docker) if you don't know what's all this about.


## Windows Containers, before Windows 2016
Containerization isn't something new. Linux 

## Windows 2016 flavours


## Use the Powershell Luke
A lot of historical Microsoft native tools are finding their way into the Linux and OSX worl; 
one of them is Powershell.

### No PS support for OSX or Linux, yet...
With [Powershell 6](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases), you are already able to use Powershell on OSX or Linux, the problem is that
remote connections still don't work.
Keep an eye on [this project](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-omi-provider) for cross platform support.
