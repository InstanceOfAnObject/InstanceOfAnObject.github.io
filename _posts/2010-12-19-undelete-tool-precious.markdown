<p>While I was moving the files from my camera to the PC, a sequence of unfortunate events occurred and I ended up deleting all the video files. I must say that I always use shift+delete to delete files and so I did this time too.</p>
<p>
On my quest for a good + free + easy software that would bring back my files I found this:<br />
<a href="http://tokiwa.qee.jp/EN/DataRecovery_EN.zip">TOKIWA DataRecovery</a><br />
</p>

<p>
The tool is plain simple and it doesn't even need to be installed, just run it and you're ready to go.<br />
</p>
Hope you'll never need it but if you do... Enjoy!
